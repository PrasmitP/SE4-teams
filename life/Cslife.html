            <p>A day in the life of a CS student involves a balance of lectures, assignments, and self-learning.
                The day typically starts with attending scheduled lectures, followed by working on assignments.
                Later they have some activities and get together with friends. Most CS students participate in clubs and
                attend club activites.<br><br />

                After dinner, some of them finish their assignments and catch up on updates and news.</p>

            <p>CS students often engage in extracurricular activities such as hackathons, coding clubs, open-source
                contributions, and tech meetups.
                They participate in coding competitions, workshops, and tech talks to enhance their skills in areas like
                app development, AI, and cybersecurity.
                Many also join clubs that focus on entrepreneurship, robotics, or software development, providing
                valuable hands-on experience and networking opportunities within the tech community.</p>

            <h2>Academic Routine</h2>
            <h3>Lectures and Labs</h3>

            <p>A typical day for a CS student includes attending lectures on subjects like algorithms, data structures,
                programming languages, and software engineering. Labs are often hands-on, involving coding assignments,
                simulations.
                Tutors are always available to help students during lab and office hours with their assignments and
                projects.c</p>

            <h3>Assignments</h3>
          
            <p>CS students often juggle multiple coding assignments with tight deadlines, requiring late nights of
                debugging and problem-solving. They manage their time carefully and rely on tools like GitHub, peer
                collaboration, and online resources to complete their tasks successfully.</p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>

            <p> Projects help students learn and take on more challenging, higher-level assignments.</p>
