            <p>A day in the life of a CS student involves a balance of lectures, working on assignments, and self-learning. 
                The day typically starts with attending lectures according to the schedule then students work on their assignments.
                Later they have some activities and get together with friends. Most CS students are in clubs and attend to that . <br><br/>

                After dinner some of them finish up with the assignments and get to read some of the updates and news</p>
