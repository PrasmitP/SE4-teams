    <h1>How to Prepare for a Computer Science Degree</h1>
    <p>
        Preparing for a computer science degree can be exciting and a bit challenging. Here's a guide to help you get
        ready effectively and set yourself up for success.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Be Engaged and Interested in Computers and Technology</h2>
    <p>
        Computer science is a rapidly evolving field, so staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends is
        essential. Engage with technology news, attend webinars, and explore new tools to deepen your interest and
        knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Build a Strong Foundation in Mathematics</h2>
    <p>
        A solid understanding of high school mathematics is crucial for grasping the math you'll encounter in college.
        Additionally, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of math that are taught in a CS
        major, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Algebra</li>
        <li>Calculus</li>
        <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Understand Computer Science Basics</h2>
    <p>
        Familiarize yourself with fundamental computer science concepts, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>Basic Computer Architecture</li>
        <li>Operating Systems</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Stay Curious</h2>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, computer science is always growing, and there's always more to learn. Staying curious and
        continuously consuming content related to computer science will give you an edge over other students!
