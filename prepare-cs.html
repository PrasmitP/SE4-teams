            <h2>2. Build a Strong Foundation in Mathematics</h2>
            <p>
                A solid understanding of high school mathematics is crucial for grasping the concepts you'll encounter
                in
                college.
                Additionally, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of math taught in a CS
                major,
                such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Algebra</li>
                <li>Calculus</li>
                <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
                <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="whiteBox">
            <h2>3. Understand Computer Science Basics</h2>
            <p>
                Familiarize yourself with fundamental computer science concepts, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Basic Computer Architecture</li>
                <li>Operating Systems</li>
                <li>Programming</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="whiteBox">
            <h2>4. Stay Curious</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, computer science is an ever-growing field, and there's always more to learn.
                Staying
                curious and continuously consuming content related to computer science will give you an edge over other
                students!
